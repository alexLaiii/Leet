Idea:
- Expand from the middle to find all possible palindromic substrings for every possible center.
  - Each character in s can be a possible center, so we try every character as center, 
    expand outwards, and count how many palindromes we can find.
- There are two types of palindromes: odd and even.
  - Odd palindrome examples: "ooo" â€” we treat the middle "o" as the center and expand.
  - Even palindrome examples: "oo" â€” we treat the gap between the two "o"s as the center and expand.
  - When using left = right = center, we only consider **odd** palindromes.
    - For example, in the string "oooo", if we only use odd-center logic, 
      we can place the center at the second or third "o", 
      but we will never consider "oooo" because either `left` or `right` will go out of bounds before covering all four characters.
  - Therefore, we also need to handle even-length palindromes by initializing left = center - 1 and right = center,
    so that both characters are considered the center.
    - Now in the "oooo" case, the second and third "o" are treated as the center, and as we expand, "oooo" will be correctly counted.

Implementation:
- A palindrome can be either odd-length (like "aba") or even-length (like "aa")
- Odd-length palindromes have a single character as the center
- Even-length palindromes have a center between two characters
- For each character in the string, we:
  - Expand around it to count all odd-length palindromes
  - Expand between it and the previous character to count even-length palindromes

Why Expand Around Center Is Optimal for Palindrome Detection:

- A palindrome is defined by symmetry around its center.
  Therefore, it's more natural and efficient to expand outward from each center 
  (either a character or a gap between characters) instead of checking substrings from both ends.

- Expanding from the center allows early termination:
  As soon as s[left] != s[right], expansion stops immediately â€” no need to scan to the middle.

- In contrast, checking from the outer edges (i.e., brute-force substring validation) 
  requires full traversal toward the center even if the first or second characters already break symmetry.

- There are only 2n - 1 possible centers in a string of length n,
  while the number of substrings is n(n + 1)/2.
  This means center-expansion considers far fewer candidates than edge-based brute-force.

- Overall, expanding from the center is both structure-aware and computationally efficient 
  for finding or counting palindromic substrings.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
