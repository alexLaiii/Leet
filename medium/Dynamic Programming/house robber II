ðŸ’¡ Intuition
To solve this problem, we consider the constraint that the first and last houses are adjacent in a circular arrangement â€” meaning we cannot rob both.

So, we divide the problem into two linear subproblems:

Include the first house, which means we exclude the last house. So we rob houses from index 0 to n-2.

Exclude the first house, which means we can include the last house. So we rob houses from index 1 to n-1.

We solve both cases using the original House Robber logic, and return the maximum of the two results.
