"""
Sort characters in a string by decreasing frequency.

Approach:
- Count occurrences of each character.
- Push (âˆ’freq, char) pairs into a min-heap to simulate a max-heap.
- Pop from the heap and append `char * freq` chunks to a list.
- Join chunks into the final string.

Complexity: O(n log k) time, where n = len(s), k = #distinct chars; O(n) space.
