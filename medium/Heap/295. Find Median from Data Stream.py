"""
Maintain the running median in O(log n) per insert using two heaps:
  - maxHeap (store negatives): lower half of numbers
  - minHeap: upper half of numbers

Intuition:
  Split the stream into two halves so that every number in the lower half
  (maxHeap) is <= every number in the upper half (minHeap). The median is
  on the boundary: either the top of maxHeap (odd count) or the average of
  both tops (even count). After each insertion, restore:
    1) Order invariant: max(lower) <= min(upper)
    2) Size invariant: len(maxHeap) == len(minHeap) or len(maxHeap) == len(minHeap) + 1
       (i.e., lower may hold one extra)

        Insert one number while preserving the two-heap invariants.
    
        Classification rule:
          - If maxHeap is non-empty and num < -self.maxHeap[0], push to maxHeap (lower half).
          - Elif minHeap is non-empty and num > self.minHeap[0], push to minHeap (upper half).
          - Else: push to maxHeap by convention. Either side is valid here because `num`
            lies between the two tops and will sit at the boundary regardless.
    
        Rebalance:
          - If len(maxHeap) -1 > len(minHeap): move the top of maxHeap to minHeap.
          - If len(minHeap) -1 > len(maxHeap): move the top of minHeap to maxHeap.
    
        Rationale:
          - The comparisons place `num` on the correct side of the boundary.
          - Rebalancing restores the size invariant while preserving order:
            max(lower) â‰¤ min(upper).
    
        Complexity: O(log n) per insert (heap push/pop); O(1) to read the median.
