"""
This problem is essentially the same as **"130. Surrounded Regions"**.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Idea:

Similar to *Surrounded Regions*, we use **DFS from the border** and mark all land cells that are **not enclaves** (i.e., land cells that can reach the border). These are stored in a `visited` set.

This time, however, the goal is to **count the land cells that are enclaves** â€” meaning they **cannot** reach any border.

So in the final loop, we simply count every land cell (`1`) that is **not in the `visited` set**.

---

### âœ… Summary:
- Use DFS from the borders to find land cells that are *not* enclaves.
- Traverse the entire grid and count all remaining land cells that aren't visited.

Time Complexity:
- **O(m Ã— n)**  
  Each cell is visited at most once by DFS, and the final counting loop is also O(m Ã— n).

Space Complexity:
- **O(m Ã— n)** worst case  
  If the entire grid is land, the `visited` set and DFS recursion stack can grow to O(m Ã— n).

"""
To save space for visited, I update each traveled cell to 0 (flood), so I dont need to maintain a visited set.
Now, in the final loop, if anything is 1, it must be an enclaves.
