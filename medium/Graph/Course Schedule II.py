"""
Use same idea from Course Schedule but track the path of course finishing.
Topological Sort via DFS.

Idea:
We apply topological sorting to determine a valid order in which to take courses.

- A course with no prerequisites can be taken immediately.
- For each course, we perform a DFS to recursively visit all of its prerequisites.
- We mark nodes as visited during DFS to detect cycles (i.e., circular dependencies).
- After visiting all prerequisites of a course, we add the course to the result list.
  This ensures that prerequisites are always added before the course that depends on them.
- The graph is built such that each course maps to a list of its prerequisites (i.e., course â†’ prereqs).

Since we're adding courses post-recursively, the result is already in the correct topological order (no need to reverse).

Time Complexity: O(V+E)
