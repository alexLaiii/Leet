ðŸ§  Sliding Window Keyword Trick:

If your goal is to **Count the number of valid subarrays/windows**:
â†’ Try using `atMost(k) - atMost(k - 1)` to avoid missing overlapping windows.

If your goal is to **find the best subarray/window** (e.g., shortest, longest, max/min), You want only one optimal window:
â†’ Use standard sliding window with greedy shrinking.
