"""
This is a relatively easy problem If using Heap as a solution
Merge k sorted linked lists using a min-heap.

Idea:
- Keep a heap of the current smallest node from each list.
- Heap items are (node.val, tieBreaker, node), where tieBreaker is the
  list index `i` the node came from. This tiebreaker prevents Python
  from comparing `ListNode` objects when values are equal and gives a
  total ordering for tuples.

How it works:
1) Push each non-empty list head as (val, i, node).
2) Pop the smallest; append it to the output (via dummy/tail).
3) If that node has a next, push (next.val, i, next) using the SAME
   tieBreaker `i`, so the heap always holds at most one node per list.

Correctness:
- The heap always contains the smallest unmerged node from each list,
  so repeated popâ†’append yields a globally sorted merge.

Complexity:
- Time: O(N log k) for N total nodes, k lists (each node push+pop).
- Space: O(k) extra for the heap (plus O(N) for the result).
